# <center>Petri Nets</center>

<p style="text-align:right">Initiated by Minbo Chung<br/>21 Sept 2023</p>

This project is started to study the properties of Petri nets. Petri nets are essential foundation tools in Workflow management systems. It analyses the flow of events and resources (e.g. cases) theoretically.

One of the courses in Explanatory Data Analysis Track at TU/e DSAI MSc, motivated me to implement the net because it involves the importance of creativity in building the workflow system and there are many possible ways to build them.

Petri nets can be used to analyze not only the flow in logistics but also how to software is designed. It's pretty damn cool.

Without a further ado, I would like to quickly start implementing the net.

The more I study the theory, this net implementation will be more accurate.

## Software and OS used
```{python}
Python: 3.11.xx
Windows 11
```

## Details
The details of the implementation intentions and how to use the net will be presented in ```main.ipynb```.
